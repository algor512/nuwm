# nuwm

`nuwm` is a small dynamic window manager for X, designed solely for my personal use. Of course, you
are welcome to use it, modify it, fork it, do whatever you want, but I probably won't merge changes
that I wouldn't need.

# TODO

Improve the handling of annoying popup windows (dialogs, etc).
